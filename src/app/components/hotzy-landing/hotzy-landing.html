      <h2 class="story-title">Our Story</h2>

      <div class="story-content">

        <p>
          We started Hotzy during one of the most uncertain times in the world —
          the COVID-19 lockdown. As an engineer and a doctor, we suddenly found
          ourselves at home with time to reflect and a strong desire to build
          something meaningful together.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of waiting for normal life to return, we decided to take a bold
          step forward. Our journey began with small-scale chili cultivation and
          simple kitchen experiments. What started as curiosity quickly turned
          into passion.
        </p>

        <p>
          We spent countless hours testing flavors, adjusting heat levels, and
          perfecting recipes that delivered both bold taste and authentic spice.
          In the early days, production was small and hands-on. Every bottle
          represented our commitment to quality, freshness, and real ingredients.
        </p>

        <p>
          Encouraged by the positive response from friends, family, and early
          customers, we continued to grow step by step. Today, Hotzy has evolved
          into a certified and trusted company supported by a dedicated and
          expanding team.
        </p>

        <p class="story-highlight">
          Clean ingredients. Fresh production. Real heat.
